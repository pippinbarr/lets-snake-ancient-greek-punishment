*Let's Snake: Ancient Greek Punishment* is an adaptation of my 2011 game [*Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment*](/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment) into the videogame language of Snake.

## History

Quite frankly, I made this game as a way to make something that would largely "design itself" and also "implement itself" by leaning on a preexisting template of Snake (from *SNAKISMS*) and a preexisting set of design ideas from the *Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment* series. As such it was largely an exercise purely of translation/adaptation where I repeatedly asked "how would this work in the Snake world?"

And now here we are.

## Technology

*Let's Snake: Ancient Greek Punishment* was created using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) along with [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) for touch gestures (swipes).
