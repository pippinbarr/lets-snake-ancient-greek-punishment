# To-dos

## General Snake
- ~~Walls are misaligned~~
- ~~Text is misaligned~~
- ~~Head collision is delayed by one~~
- More confusing than cute ~~I think the game Tint the apple to the different classic LPAG colours? Kind of cute?~~
- ~~There's a single tick sound right at the start?~~
- ~~General oddness around the tick and triggering events/sounds~~
-~~ Touch controls~~
    - Swipe based even better ~~Menu touch-based~~
    - ~~Games swipe-based~~

- There's always more bug checking in the banana stand - but is there?

## Sisyphus

- Yes this is what should happen ~~What should happen if you don't eat an apple soon enough? Should they "roll back down"?~~
- ~~Fix the instructions to say USE ARROW TO CONTROL SSSYSSYPHUSSS har har~~
- ~~Remove ability to get to the menu~~
- ~~Continue work on implementing the rollback of an apple (should happen for reaching top and for not eating the next apple within a small number of ticks, should it be reversable or it just happens and that's that?)~~
- ~~Force rollback at top...~~
- ~~What is wall/self death? Respawn with no fuss?~~

## Prometheus

- Oopsie, got so enthused I didn't write any todos for the majority of this ~~Get it working~~
- Trying that out for now ~~Should the hover go vertically up? It's a bit complicated... maybe the eagle should come in at a slower tick? How? Eagle tick?~~
- Added a move sound on struggle ~~Attention to sound~~

## Tantalus

- ~~Snake in the middle, apple above apple below~~
- ~~Apple retreats outside walls based on your distance from it~~
- ~~Death is a reset~~

## Danaids

- ~~After apple-eat, drain points (delay with a timer, have a sound per tick)~~

## Zeno

- Thank you, I did. See the journal for philosophizing. ~~Make it~~
