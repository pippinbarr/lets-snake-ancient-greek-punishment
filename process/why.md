# Why?

## #1, Monday 24 June 2024

Most of all because I'm a bit stuck on game making, too often inclined toward projects that get out of scope and that I end up needing to spend months finishing. So: snake-game x punishment-game is a meeting of two ideas I've done plenty of times before, it should design and develop "itself".

Might be at all interesting from a "research" perspective? Let's imagine things like

- Adaptation
- Expressive play
- Dissemination

Or, you know, whatever.
